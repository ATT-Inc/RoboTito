## üëã How to invite it
You can invite the original RoboTito to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=820819824669491210&permissions=8&scope=bot)

### üìÉ NOTE: 
As we said above, we speak spanish principally, so we write RoboTito's code in spanish.

## üó∫ Not an spanish speaker?
We managed to write RoboTito in a way that you can take the code and change the language easily. The only (we hope) thing you have to do is to rewrite the sentences, in the code or in the databases, in the language you want to work with the bot.

**For example**: if you want to change the sentences that appears in the gifs commands, you have to change the sentences that are saved on "databases/db_str.json" with the ones that you like.

## üë®‚Äçüíª Contributing or using RoboTito's code
We are not watching for direct contributors, but, if you want to do it, you can.

### üî∞ GUIDELINES:
- Don't make changes to destroy the bot, is not funny :S
- Don't mind for working with your own language, we prefer spanish, but if you write in english it's not a problem.
