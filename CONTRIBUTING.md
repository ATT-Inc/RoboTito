# üåå Contributing to RoboTito
RoboTito is intended to be open-source, or at least be a base for any other bot. We don't prioritize functions that are mostly private (like store user's info in our databases or something) but we will like to have it in the future.  
We are going to work in RoboTito as much as we can, but if you want to support the project making your contributions, we really appreciate it.

## ü™ê Before start coding...
We are going to test all of your changes, but we will appreciate if you [make your own application in Discord developers](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and test it there before pushing.

## ‚ö° Coding
1. Fork the repository.
2. Clone your fork in your computer, install the required packages and start making your changes.
3. When your tests are done, push your fork and make a pull request describing your additions / fixes / etc.
4. Now is our turn to analyze and test, thank you!

## Considerations
- Don't break things that works.
- We preffer english or spanish, comment your code!
- Don't make clones of RoboTito, please, is not great!
- We offer you the posibility of contributing, if you make good work, we are going to recognize you.
