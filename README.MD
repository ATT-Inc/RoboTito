# Welcome to RoboTito's Development branch!
Here we are constantly working on the commands, ideas and projects we have got.

Until we are not sure that this changes can go to the master branch, we leave them here.

## How you can contribute?
Is not that hard, you can do things like:

- Create a pull request with the label:
    - *feature*: for telling us about an idea or feature to implement.
    - *request*: for requesting changes or information about something.
    - *lang-fixes*: for advicing about misses in the writing (we are not native english speakers.)
    - *testing*: if you tested the bot, you can tell us about your experiences with it.

- Create issues:
    - We are glad to know that the bot has issues, please, tell us about them on the **Issues** tab.

- Talking to us in our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/W2ReeE6kV5) **ATTENTION**: we are Argentinians, so we mostly speak spanish.

## Thank you!
