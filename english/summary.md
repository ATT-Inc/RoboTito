# Summary

### What is RoboTito? ðŸ¤”

RoboTito is a Discord bot focused on simplicity, functionality and ease of use, while seeking to innovate with its features.

It is intended to be an open source project, which means that you can view the bot code through its development stages to see its progress, changes and everything it comprises. To see all the components of RoboTito, access its repository [here](https://github.com/Ti7oyan/RoboTito).

### Features âš™

* **Ease of use**, you can start using RoboTito as soon as it enters your server. 
* **Variety of commands**, because even though we don't offer a huge amount of commands, we focus our efforts on bringing features that you don't see everywhere, giving that unique touch to the bot. 
* **100% Spanish**, this is maybe the worst obstacle of the all bot. Well, we are spanish speakers developing a bot for spanish speakers but hey! The bot is intended to be used even if you don't speak spanish natively so go and explore it. 
* **Constant development**, we dedicate a lot of time to RoboTito to make it grow every time we work on it. 
* **Open to suggestions**, because we want it to be the best version of itself.

2. **We do not make or ask for money for RoboTito**, the bot is free and available to anyone.
3. **We don't collect your data and we don't care about it**, all we are looking for with RoboTito is to make you and your friends have a good time exploring the bot's different features.
